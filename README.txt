## Installation

After enabling this this module as normal you need to:

1. Add an admin API Token from HipChat and the default room to receive
   messages at /admin/config/services/hipchat
2. Download the hipchat-php library from Github
   https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-php  and place it inside your libraries
   directory. This is often found at sites/all/libraries and you may need to
   create it.
   If your libraries are located at sites/all/libraries, place the hipchat-php
   library at sites/all/libraries/hipchat-php such that HipChat.php can be found
   at:
   * sites/all/libraries/hipchat-php/src/HipChat/HipChat.php
